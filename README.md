## 🚀 Quick Start: How to Run This Project

### 1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuvrajsharmaaa/Cyber_Stalk.git
cd Cyber_Stalk
```

### 2. **Set up Python environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. **Install dependencies**
- Make sure your `requirements.txt` includes:
  ```
  fastapi
  uvicorn
  sqlalchemy
  psycopg2-binary
  aiofiles
  python-dotenv
  ```
- Then run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 4. **Set up the Database**
- By default, the project uses SQLite (`cyberstalk.db` will be created automatically).
- To use PostgreSQL, update the connection string in `database.py` or set a `DATABASE_URL` in a `.env` file.

### 5. **Initialize the database**
- If using SQLAlchemy's `Base.metadata.create_all`:
  ```python
  # In a Python shell:
  from main import Base, engine
  Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)
  ```

### 6. **Run the FastAPI server**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
